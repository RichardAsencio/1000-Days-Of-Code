### Day 33: Sunday May 10th, 2020


#### **Today's Progress:** 

* finished Chapter 1 out of 13 of Packt> HTML & CSS Workshop 



#### **Insights or thoughts:**

* I am very optimistic about making progress in learning HTML & CSS to finally start creating and deploying webpages as part of my portfolio and to have plain fun doing so

#### **Plans for tomorrow:**

1. will do typing practice from Level 1 thru level 23 and then assess whta levels I need to keep practicing on.These levels are all for the HOME row and I want to be good at them before moving to top row 

2. start with w3c web design course / update GitHub repo

3. start with interneting is hard / update GitHub repo

4. catch up again with the Hack Reactor / update GitHub repo

5. continue with fcc / update GitHub repo

6. continue with headfirst / update GitHub repo 

7. continue with the Pack web design course / update GitHub repo




// 1. what's the file gitignore for? should I have one on each of my repos?
  
// 2. return to [UNIX for Mac OS X Users](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/unix-for-mac-os-x-users/introduction) to Part Three Finder Aliases in UNIX and try to finish this part and leave part four of Sunday, and succesively each part to be done per day (the course has  9 parts) ... once one part is covered move to Typing, Hack Reactor, Git/GiyHub, Web Dev, Web Design, and Python Webscrapers 

// 3. I will continue to include in this log the agenda and all activities actually performed and related to my Software Career journey, even if it is not coding per se, so that as I get started in my day, I start writing my notes here of all I did during the day that is related to this career-change journey; from job search efforts, social media resources I follow, to reading related books, related TV series, people I get to know, course started and finished,  conferences attended, etc

//4. continue reading [Mining Social Media](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mining-social-media/9781098122621/xhtml/cover.xhtml)   

    ## Draft of Daily Agenda: 

    * *TYPING* / - practice typing

    * *HACK REACTOR* / - do a minimum amount of three hours of my Hack Reactor curriculum, and then go thru all my Udemy JavaScript courses, then do Head First JavaScript, then Eloquent JavaScript, then do Watch and Code basic/free portion by Gordon Zhu, and then enr0ll into his paid version of the course Gordon Zhu Watch & Code

    * *WEB DEV - HTML & CSS & JavaScript* / - 2 hours of any HTML/CSS. Start with Head First HTML, and then fCC's Responsive Web Design certification, then W3School HTML and CSS certificates, Packt HTML & CSS certification, LinkedIn courses to hang up in my LinkedIn profile, then do Head First HTML5, then my Udemy Web Dev & Design courses. When done with these courses dive into my many books of HTML/CSS & JavaScript

    * *WEB DESIGN - UI & UX* / - 1 hour of my Designer Udemy courses   
    
    * *PYTHON* / - I want to include Python in my daily activities (do my self taught course) because I am so interested in Data Science (data mining & Analysis), Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI ..d. these days I've come across of DeepFake videos, and web scrapers, and Social Data Mining, automatign by using scripts, etc etc that I want to tackle small projects, like creating or using a web scraper or crawler [ start lokking into thses resources: [10 Best Open Source Web Scraper in 2020](https://www.octoparse.com/blog/10-best-open-source-web-scraper), [How to Build a Web Crawler– A Guide for Beginners](https://www.octoparse.com/blog/how-to-build-a-web-crawler-from-scratch-a-guide-for-beginners) [Apify - Extract Data form Any ](https://apify.com/), [Apify Technologies @ GitHub](https://github.com/apifytech), [ApifyTech @ GitHub](https://github.com/apifytech/apify-js) ], then doing social media mining and analysis [ [Mining Social Media](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mining-social-media/9781098122621/xhtml/cover.xhtml) ], doing deepfake videos for fun, etc [ [FaceSwap](https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap) & [DeepFaceLab](https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab) ]     

// 5. research and learn about the Terminal and XCode, and Homebrew. Try LinkedIn lEARN, YouTube Corey Schafer and many resources

// 6. complete the Corey Shafer tutorial on [Homebrew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SELYgZvAZbU) 

// 7. check this other video y Corey Schafer on [How I Setup a New Development Machine - using scripts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=kIdiWut8eD8&feature=emb_logo) to automate installs and Save Time 

// 8. learn Homebrew with LinkedIn lEARN platform Corey Schafer You Tube videos / I want to get familiar with HOMEBREW which seems to be a package installer of MAC for the Terminal and see if I have the latest version and if not then see if I can update it. Check first for my LinkedIn LEARN resources as my experience with the Git Essential course was fantastic, and I should leverge my LinkedIn susbcription not only to learn but also if I can hang in my LinkedIn profile any courses finished at the LinkedIn LEARN platform I need to do so ...  

// 9. Once I am familiar with Homebrew I want to research How To Update Git in both my laptops MAC and PC which as of today is 2.23.0 (my MacBook says my curr versions are git version 2.23.0 and 2.26.1.windows.1 respectively)

// 10. Watch any tutorial related to Windows bash terminal 

// 11. continue to sharpen my Git/GitHub skills, this time go back and review Git/GitHub forking, to fork a very nice repo that Robert Groves starred called [Xtremilicious ProjectLearn-Project-Based-Learning](https://github.com/Xtremilicious/ProjectLearn-Project-Based-Learning)

// 12.  watch and do some coding practice with a LikedIn Git Tutorial [Git Essential Training: The Basics](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/git-essential-training-the-basics/use-git-version-control-software-to-manage-project-code) 
// * at the LinkedIn video course I saw that depending on how you installed Git initially you could access it thru the regular Windows Command Line, but since I couldn't access it thru my regular command line but only thru the Bash profile, I went ahead and erased my PC Git Installation, which also erased the Bash software profile, and re-installed again (per the video instructions) and as it turned out, I can't access my git commands thru the regular command line prompt but since I erased my Git, now I have the latest version of it in my Windows machine, which as of today is "git version 2.26.1.windows.1 

// 13. read and follow this [Medium](https://medium.com/@jonathanmines/the-ultimate-github-collaboration-guide-df816e98fb67) article that illustrates on a step by step fashion a certin type of collaboration workflow.

// 14. watch some more video tutorials that I have discovered on Git and choose another one to practice

### Day 32: Saturday May 9th, 2020


#### **Today's Progress:** 

* did Packt> HTML & CSS Workshop until CSS Specificity 

// * did one hour of typing practice with [Typesy](https://www.typesy.com/) 
// * did one hour of fCC Responsive Web Design, practicing forms, input, and regular buttons, and continued to practice within my own [freeCodeCamp-Projects-Certs](https://github.com/RichardAsencio/freeCodeCamp-Projects-Certs)
// * did two hours of [Head First HTML and CSS](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-html/9781449324469/). I was able to finish the first chapter.


#### **Insights or thoughts:**

* my tiping speed sucks and has not improved as much as I would like, I am trying to make it a habit to practice everyday, with intention and persistence to improve. The target typong speed is over 80 words per minute and right now I am well below 20

* I really want to see how I can balance my time between 1-practicing JavaScript, which is the priority to be ready to take the TI as soon as the pandemic situation goes away and moneywise I return to normal and 2- being able to start building and creating stuff that I can share with others, like a designing and uploading webpages. This second activity will also allow me to start having personal projects to start my portfolio, start my personal blog, and start earning credentials for my LinkedIn profile such as the fcc, w3c and packt for front end skills. 




// * I continue to be stuck just in the Hack Reactor material and havent had a chance to continue advancing on my other interests such as Git/GitHub / Web Dev - HTML/CSS and Python Webscrapping (Social Media Mining) thing  

// * I need to focus first and foremost in my Hack Reactor / Galvanize resources and then in the other stuff 

// * I am trying to be done with my basic knowledge gaps as it relates to command line, Terminal, Bash Shell, homebrew etc, so I can resume my Git/GitHub learning and pratice 

// * continue on learning Git/GitHub, the Terminal, Bash, XCode, Homebrew and all things command line related both in my Macbook and my Surfacebook 

// * I wonder if I can set up time aside to follow the Python, WebScrapper, Social Media Mining thing] 


#### **Plans for tomorrow:**

1. will do typing practice from Level 1 thru level 23 and then assess whta levels I need to keep practicing on.
These levels are all for the HOME row and I want to be good at them before moving to top row

// 1.  I WILL RESTART with the Galvanize curriculum / check on my GitHub repo to follow the PATH Timeline 

// 2. what's the file gitignore for? should I have one on each of my repos?

### Day 29: Wednesday, May 6th, 2020


#### **Today's Progress:** 

* today I created a new GitHub repo named [freeCodeCamp-Projects-Certs](https://github.com/RichardAsencio/freeCodeCamp-Projects-Certs) to get started daily spending a daily amount of time and house my projects and certifications earned as I go thru the courses


#### **Insights or thoughts:**

* I continue to be stuck just in the Hack Reactor material and havent had a chance to continue advancing on my other interests such as Git/GitHub / Web Dev - HTML/CSS and Python Webscrapping (Social Media Mining) thing  

* I need to focus first and foremost in my Hack Reactor / Galvanize resources and then in the other stuff 

* I am trying to be done with my basic knowledge gaps as it relates to command line, Terminal, Bash Shell, homebrew etc, so I can resume my Git/GitHub learning and pratice 

* continue on learning Git/GitHub, the Terminal, Bash, XCode, Homebrew and all things command line related both in my Macbook and my Surfacebook 

* I wonder if I can set up time aside to follow the Python, WebScrapper, Social Media Mining thing  


#### **Plans for tomorrow:**

1.  I WILL RESTART with the Galvanize curriculum / check on my GitHub repo to follow the PATH Timeline 

2. what's the file gitignore for? should I have one on each of my repos?
  
3. return to [UNIX for Mac OS X Users](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/unix-for-mac-os-x-users/introduction) to Part Three Finder Aliases in UNIX and try to finish this part and leave part four of Sunday, and succesively each part to be done per day (the course has  9 parts) ... once one part is covered move to Typing, Hack Reactor, Git/GiyHub, Web Dev, Web Design, and Python Webscrapers 

4. I will continue to include in this log the agenda and all activities actually performed and related to my Software Career journey, even if it is not coding per se, so that as I get started in my day, I start writing my notes here of all I did during the day that is related to this career-change journey; from job search efforts, social media resources I follow, to reading related books, related TV series, people I get to know, course started and finished,  conferences attended, etc

5. continue reading [Mining Social Media](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mining-social-media/9781098122621/xhtml/cover.xhtml)   

    ## Draft of Daily Agenda: 

    * *TYPING* / - practice typing

### Day 25: Saturday, May 2nd, 2020


#### **Today's Progress:** 

* @HackReactor/Galvanize gLEARN platform / today did Module 0  Methods and Operators(working with strings, arrays and objects)

#### **Insights or thoughts:**

* I continue to be stuck just in the Hack Reactor material and havent had a chance to continue advancing on my other interests such as Git/GitHub / Web Dev - HTML/CSS and Python Webscrapping (Social Media Mining) thing  

* I need to focus first and foremost in my Hack Reactor / Galvanize resources and then in the other stuff 

* I am trying to be done with my basic knowledge gaps as it relates to command line, Terminal, Bash Shell, homebrew etc, so I can resume my Git/GitHub learning and pratice 

* continue on learning Git/GitHub, the Terminal, Bash, XCode, Homebrew and all things command line related both in my Macbook and my Surfacebook 

* I wonder if I can set up time aside to follow the Python, WebScrapper, Social Media Mining thing  


#### **Plans for tomorrow:**

1.  I WILL RESTART with the Galvanize curriculum / check on my GitHub repo to follow the PATH Timeline 

2. what's the file gitignore for? should I have one on each of my repos?
  
3. return to [UNIX for Mac OS X Users](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/unix-for-mac-os-x-users/introduction) to Part Three Finder Aliases in UNIX and try to finish this part and leave part four of Sunday, and succesively each part to be done per day (the course has  9 parts) ... once one part is covered move to Typing, Hack Reactor, Git/GiyHub, Web Dev, Web Design, and Python Webscrapers 

4. I will continue to include in this log the agenda and all activities actually performed and related to my Software Career journey, even if it is not coding per se, so that as I get started in my day, I start writing my notes here of all I did during the day that is related to this career-change journey; from job search efforts, social media resources I follow, to reading related books, related TV series, people I get to know, course started and finished,  conferences attended, etc

### Day 21: Tuesday April 28, 2020


#### **Today's Progress:** 

* started reviewing Hack Reactor/Galvanize material to remake a timeline for studying materials  


#### **Insights or thoughts:**

* I need to focus first and foremost in my Hack Reactor / Galvanize resources and then in the other stuff 

* I am trying to be done with my basic knowledge gaps as it relates to command line, Terminal, Bash Shell, homebrew etc, so I can resume my Git/GitHub learning and pratice 

* continue on learning Git/GitHub, the Terminal, Bash, XCode, Homebrew and all things command line related both in my Macbook and my Surfacebook 

* I wonder if I can set up time aside to follow the Python, WebScrapper, Social Media Mining thing  


#### **Plans for tomorrow:**

1.  I WILL RESTART with the Galvanize curriculum / check on my GitHub repo to follow the PATH Timeline 

2. what's the file gitignore for? should I have one on each of my repos?
  
3. return to [UNIX for Mac OS X Users](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/unix-for-mac-os-x-users/introduction) to Part Three Finder Aliases in UNIX and try to finish this part and leave part four of Sunday, and succesively each part to be done per day (the course has  9 parts) ... once one part is covered move to Typing, Hack Reactor, Git/GiyHub, Web Dev, Web Design, and Python Webscrapers 

4. I will continue to include in this log the agenda and all activities actually performed and related to my Software Career journey, even if it is not coding per se, so that as I get started in my day, I start writing my notes here of all I did during the day that is related to this career-change journey; from job search efforts, social media resources I follow, to reading related books, related TV series, people I get to know, course started and finished,  conferences attended, etc

5. continue reading [Mining Social Media](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mining-social-media/9781098122621/xhtml/cover.xhtml)   

    ## Draft of Daily Agenda: 

    * *TYPING* / - practice typing

    * 1 hour of practice with any Git/GitHub course with the goal of starting to contrinute to an open source project / also read my GitHub For Dummies book
    * 2 hours of any HTML/CSS. Start with Head First HTML, and then fCC's Responsive Web Design certification, then W3School HTML and CSS certificates, Packt HTML & CSS certification, LinkedIn courses to hang up in my LinkedIn profile, then do Head First HTML5, then my Udemy Web Dev & Design courses
    * 1 hour of my Designer Udemy courses    
    * X amount of hours left to go thru my Hack Reactor curriculum, go thru all my Udemy JavaScript course, then do Head First JavaScript, then Eloquent JavaScript and then do Watch and Code basic/free portion by Grodon Zhu, and then enrill into his paid version of the course 
    * when done with these courses dive into my many books of HTML/CSS & JavaScript

2. research and learn about the Terminal and XCode, and Homebrew. Try LinkedIn lEARN, YouTube Corey Schafer and many resources

3. complete the Corey Shafer tutorial on [Homebrew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SELYgZvAZbU) 

4. check this other video y Corey Schafer on [How I Setup a New Development Machine - using scripts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=kIdiWut8eD8&feature=emb_logo) to automate installs and Save Time 

5. learn Homebrew with LinkedIn lEARN platform Corey Schafer You Tube videos / I want to get familiar with HOMEBREW which seems to be a package installer of MAC for the Terminal and see if I have the latest version and if not then see if I can update it. Check first for my LinkedIn LEARN resources as my experience with the Git Essential course was fantastic, and I should leverge my LinkedIn susbcription not only to learn but also if I can hang in my LinkedIn profile any courses finished at the LinkedIn LEARN platform I need to do so ...  

6. Once I am familiar with Homebrew I want to research How To Update Git in both my laptops MAC and PC which as of today is 2.23.0 (my MacBook says my curr versions are git version 2.23.0 and 2.26.1.windows.1 respectively)

7. Watch any tutorial related to Windows bash terminal 

8. continue to sharpen my Git/GitHub skills 

9.  watch and do some coding practice with a LikedIn Git Tutorial [Git Essential Training: The Basics](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/git-essential-training-the-basics/use-git-version-control-software-to-manage-project-code) 
* at the LinkedIn video course I saw that depending on how you installed Git initially you could access it thru the regular Windows Command Line, but since I couldn't access it thru my regular command line but only thru the Bash profile, I went ahead and erased my PC Git Installation, which also erased the Bash software profile, and re-installed again (per the video instructions) and as it turned out, I can't access my git commands thru the regular command line prompt but since I erased my Git, now I have the latest version of it in my Windows machine, which as of today is "git version 2.26.1.windows.1 

10. watch again LikedIn Git Tutorial [Git Essential Training: The Basics](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/git-essential-training-the-basics/use-git-version-control-software-to-manage-project-code) 

11. read and follow this [Medium](https://medium.com/@jonathanmines/the-ultimate-github-collaboration-guide-df816e98fb67) article that illustrates on a step by step fashion a certin type of collaboration workflow.

12. watch some more video tutorials that I have discovered on Git and choose another one to practice

13. create practice repo related to my HTML & CSS learning effort tru this resource: [Head First HTML & CSS, 2nd Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-html/9781449324469/)

--------------------------------------------------------


### Day 6: Monday April 13, 2020
*Posted on Wednesday April 15 2020*


#### **Today's Progress:** 

* did not practiced JavaScript during the past few days, so I did today, for two hours with some Hack Reactor's Prep Course JavaScript coding challenges at he G-Learn platform


#### **Insights or thoughts:**

* even as I have been practicing for Hack Reactor's Admission's Technical Inteview, I decided not to take it due to the Coronavirus situation as my income generating ability moving forward is uncertain and I do not want to start the next month with a new monthly liability of $350 for the student loan that I have to take to get started with the bootcamp, plus shelling out $2000 cash for the deposit; right now this is not a smart financial decision so this project has to wait until there's more short term visibility and less income generating uncertainty 

* related to my this decision I will then continue to practice JavaScript to remain warm and continue to strengthen my JavaScript coding skills, but now since I am not at a race to enroll at the next cohort that starts on May I can fragment my study time into 1-JavaScript, 2-Web Design (with FreeCodeCamp and other resources) and 3-Git Collaboration learning resources and startig to engage in an Open Source Project as soon as ready to do so  

* this forced decision does not frustrates me as I am taking the long view with this effort of mine of making a career change into software development 


#### **Plans for tomorrow:**

1. watch some more video tutorials that I have discovered on Git and choose another one to practice
2. read and follow this [Medium](https://medium.com/@jonathanmines/the-ultimate-github-collaboration-guide-df816e98fb67) article that illustrates on a step by step fashion a certin type of collaboration workflow.
3. create practice repo related to my HTML & CSS learning effort tru this resource: [Head First HTML & CSS, 2nd Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-html/9781449324469/)


--------------------------------------------------------


### Day 5: Sunday April 12, 2020
*Posted On Monday April 13 2020*


#### **Today's Progress:** 

* I attended a remote meetup lecture on the Command Line lead by Robert Groves from freeCodeCamp-Chicago-Loop. Here's the [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hz76wreljql1go3/AAD6WSDEoO94iEEaiZQF1dP4a?dl=0) to the lecture recording 

* spent a couple hours between praticing Git with a Colt Steele youtube videos titled [Learn Git in 15 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE) 


#### **Insights or thoughts:**

* I continue on a focused effort to really be skillful on Git/GitHub, I feel as it will allow me to finally resch out to the Git Community, start saving my progress and learning resources as well as geting started collaborating and startingto contribute to an Open Source project of my choosing.


#### **Plans for tomorrow:**

1. watch some more video tutorials that I have discovered on Git and choose which ones to practice
2. read and follow this [Medium](https://medium.com/@jonathanmines/the-ultimate-github-collaboration-guide-df816e98fb67) article that illustrates on a step by step fashion a certin type of collaboration workflow.

--------------------------------------------------------


### Day 4: Saturday April 11, 2020


#### **Today's Progress:** 

* did another [practice repo](https://github.com/RichardAsencio/practiceREPO) in GitHub 


#### **Insights or thoughts:**

Since I got to have some working understanding of Git/GitHUb I am on a mission to really hammer down my newly learned git skills. As I continue to practice and review some other resources I keep practicing as well as learning some other commands.  


#### **Plans for tomorrow:**
1. watch some more video tutorials that I have discovered 
2. work again thru the hello-world course step by step but with another repo name, with a simple HTML doc, in which I create the html doc in a few steps and go about creating perhaps two branches, one for HTML doc, make pull request, merge it and close it, then another branch for a css file, make a pull request, merge it and close it   
3. read and follow this [Medium](https://medium.com/@jonathanmines/the-ultimate-github-collaboration-guide-df816e98fb67) article that illustrates on a step by step fashion a certin type of collaboration workflow.
4. create practice repo related to my HTML & CSS learning effort tru this resource: [Head First HTML & CSS, 2nd Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-html/9781449324469/)


--------------------------------------------------------


### Day 3: Friday April 10, 2020


#### **Today's Progress:** 

* did *AGAIN* the [hello-world](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) course in GitHub and this was the [result](https://github.com/RichardAsencio/hello-world)


#### **Insights or thoughts:**

This time around I just followed the script while taking my notes, and I am feeling much better after yesterday's wreck with this.  


#### **Plans for tomorrow:**

1. work again thru the hello-world course step by step but with another repo name, with a simple HTML doc, in which I create the html doc in a few steps and go about creating perhaps two branches, one for HTML doc, make pull request, merge it and close it, then another branch for a css file, make a pull request, merge it and close it   
2. read and follow this [Medium](https://medium.com/@jonathanmines/the-ultimate-github-collaboration-guide-df816e98fb67) article that illustrates on a step by step fashion a certin type of collaboration workflow.
3. create practice repo related to my HTML & CSS learning effort tru this resource: [Head First HTML & CSS, 2nd Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-html/9781449324469/)


--------------------------------------------------------


### Day 2: Thursday April 9, 2020


#### **Today's Progress:** 

* did the [hello-world](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) course in GitHub but it was a mess, because once I finished it, I started to mess with it trying to do a collaboration work-flow. Like adding and trying to add collaborators, assignees or reviewers and I couldn't make it work. So from my RichuackFCC I forked the repo, and tried making pull requests, issues, merges, from the repo base account RichardAsencio, then from the RichuackFCC account, but to no avail. In the end I did not understood the sequence created, so I ended deleting the forked repo from RichuackFCC and also from RichardAsencio. If time allows, I will do this mini course again tonight if not tomorrow.   


#### **Insights or thoughts:**

As I created a mess in a simple repo trying to understand how collaboration is done with issues, pull requests, collaborators, assigneess and reviewers, the bravado feeling I had yesterday, quickly dissipated.


#### **Plans for tomorrow:**

1. work again thru the hello-world course 
2. read and follow this [Medium](https://medium.com/@jonathanmines/the-ultimate-github-collaboration-guide-df816e98fb67) article that illustrates on a step by step fashion a certin type of collaboration workflow.
3. create practice repo related to my HTML & CSS learning effort tru this resource: [Head First HTML & CSS, 2nd Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-html/9781449324469/)


--------------------------------------------------------


### Day 1: Wednesday April 8, 2020


#### **Today's Progress:** 
* did the [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) course on GitHub 
* related to this intro course I created a repo called: [github-slideshow](https://github.com/RichardAsencio/github-slideshow)


#### **Insights or thoughts:**

I first tried GitHub in early [2016](https://github.com/Richuack/web-server-2016). By then I was so far from understanding it. Fast forward, on December 2019 I again tried to start understanding and practicing with it, and this time I bought a "Github for Dummies" book, but did not get past the 15th page. I finally got lucky when on early March 2020, at a Sunday Free-Code-Camp-Chicago-Loop meet-up, the founder, Robert Groves gave a step by step talk on Git, Github and GitHub pages. That day I really made the leap and really began to understand Git, GitHub and GitHub Pages. Finally today, after going thru all this intro course from the GitHub resources, I really feel accomplished as I finally have a clear understanding, a mental map of the basic workflow of Git and GitHub. In short, today was a win for me. I feel like I can't wait to start spending time with Git and GitHub, to create and host, share and collaborate, all sorts of things, with many people, throughout my Software Developer career-change journey. 


#### **Plans for tomorrow:**
1. work thru another Intro GitHub course to keep practicing 
2. create practice repo related to my HTML & CSS learning effort tru this resource: [Head First HTML & CSS, 2nd Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-html/9781449324469/)


--------------------------------------------------------


## This is START UP day  
### Day 0: Tuesday April 7th, 2020


#### **Today's Progress:** 
* opened a brand new GitHub account under my full name 
* created this repo in my new GitHub account and locally in my MacBook
* started to get familiar with the markdown language to customize a log template
* was able to create a markdown template for my daily log entries  
* wrote my personal state of affairs reflections as I start to document this journey


#### **Insights or thoughts:**
##### My personal state-of-affairs as it relates to my career-change journey into Software Development
I've had a good run of over fifteen years career on finance/accounting roles, but around year 2015 I started toying with the idea of making a career change but had not a clue as to where to pivot. By late 2015 (in San Juan, Puerto Rico) I came across a Codetrotters Academy ad, and on early 2016 I invested $1,500.00 to attend a Web Dev Intro Course offered by the former. I naively thought: I am on my way to soon become a tech/knowledge worker in the new economy, alas, if you continue reading, you'll see my current state of affairs. 

Technically speaking, at this coding workshop I did not learned much, but a seed was planted in my mind: the certainty that the tech industry (specifically coders and programmers) was not necessarily a province only reserved for young and genius-minded folks, who spent their early years at their parents' home basements becoming code hackers. Learning to code and for that matter making a career-change into tech was now within my realm of reality. However, for $1,500.00, a rather significant amount of money paid to attend a workshop compared to what an UDEMY course (with twice the amount of skills learning content) costs, I was not able to extract much value in skills from this Codetrotters Web Dev Intro course, but was rather given a more valuable return: I gained the perspective of what at one point I considered an "off limits" option for me, but now was an open possibility. Provided that I put in the time and effort, I could, even in the worst case scenario, become a mediocre tech worker that could at least scrap an average living income as a software developer. Who cares?; I rather work for an average middle class income and be happy, than for a fortune and be unfulfilled and miserable. So I thought, this is the career-change destination I am looking for. Yet multiple disrupting life events in a tumultous year of 2016 had me wrestling with my circumstances rather than being able to chart a path to a career change.  

By mid-year of 2017, with the worst been over, life had me living in Chicago, and again I started breathing new air for my career change plans. I tried Amazon & Shopify dropshipping, lost money on online e-commerce courses with huge promises and flat results, and again ended feeling startled and down; but nevertheles kept reading and researching whatever came my way that was tech/coding related. 

Cripto-currency, blockchain, cloud computing, data science, machine learning, AI, IoT, web design, web development, frontend, backend, fullstack, Java, Python, Javascript, sql, no-sql, mongoDB, frameworks, libraries, UI, UX, devOps, cybersecurity, Kubernetes, Docker, coding bootcamps, and on and on and on ... all these terms I didn't know until recently, but by now I was becoming more knowledgeable and generally speaking, understood on a basic level, most of them. Still a year had gone by and I was now more confused than before. 

By late 2018 I had researched many boot-camps and was considering the merits of learning in a controlled, guided and structured enviroment. Out of many, Hack Reactor Software Engineer program stood out, and as I started studying their prep materials geared to clear their admissions assesment interview hurdle, I got plunged into an eureka moment: "this feels like something I can do for hours without end. I feel drawn by the abstract intelectual exercise of this type of work, as well as the creative side of it, meaning: the possiblity of creating and building stuff that could be useful not only for me but to others. Who knows, maybe I can create or contribute to build stuff that could indeed make a difference in my community, my country or to the world at large, and at the same time earn a living. This is it, I want to do this".

However, there were still many challenges ahead. This three sum them up: 
1- LACK OF STRUCTURE OR CLEAR PATH 
2- LACK OF SUPPORT 
3- LACK OF MIND CONTROL 

In the beginning, the inmense amount of learning resources available from free to paid, at first seemed like a blessing, but quickly turned into a burden as I wanted to sort the great learning courses from the mediocre ones, from an endless supply of offerings, while mixing in my Hack Reactor learning material. Also, since I am interested in learning x, y, and z, may I go thru many of these multiple resources at the same time ??? Which ones ??? In what sequence ??? A lot of time was wasted in an endless amount of started yet un-finished online courses.

Second, I was for too long shy about going out to find support. This became another source of waste of time, resources and energy, because I kept doing stuff propelled by wrong assumptions of what and how do things. Until recently I did not have a single friend in the tech industry to tend to, to make questions, to have chats regarding this, or to ask for feedback and advice; and worst, I did not reach out to anybody. 
*Ego is the enemy !!!*   

And lastly but of greater impact: LACK OF MIND CONTROL. The lack of discipline to manage distractions, the lost skill of razor focus for long periods of time, the absent ability to quickly switch to think deep and abstractively like in my days as a young book worm, made me realize these were the main reasons why I was spending a great amount of effort and hours going thru my study materials but failing to learn at all, at least at a decent speed. After missed dealines to have learned certain content, after painful failed attempts to pass TI's or other assesments of my skills, I finally came to terms with the fact that learning coding, programming or computer science was not only complex, difficult, and foreign to my lifetime knowledge context, but also that what was hindering my efforts was in my view, a cognitive impairment. My attention was too fragmented, the timespan of my focus was way too short, hence my learning curve was flat. I was taking too long to learn a thing or two, and at this pace it would take an eternity to acquire any value producing skills. In short, I had my first BIG impostor syndrome attack. 
*Stillness and Deep Work are the keys !!!*  

Since then, alongside my coding learning journey I decided to research and read many books on personal improvement topics related to: meta-learning, time management, having focus in spite today's digital distractions, and ultimately managing frustration and anger to impede this normal repetitive human conditions from leading me astray of my long sought personal goal of finding meaning, purpose and a happy life by pursuing work in a career of my liking and choosing. 

For the curious, this is a list of the books and resources that I have read in the last two years, and that I continue to reference and review again and again:

* The Obstacle Is The Way / Ryan Holiday 
* Ego Is The Enemy / Ryan Holiday
* Stillness Is The Key / Ryan Holiday
* The Daily Stoic / Ryan Holiday & Stephen Hanselman
* The Daily Stoic Journal / Ryan Holiday & Stephen Hanselman
* The Organized Mind / Daniel J. Levitin
* Ten Percent Happier / ios app and book by Dan Harris 
* Essentialism / Greg McKeown 
* The First 20 hours / Josh Kaufman  
* The Productivity Project / Chris Bailey 
* Super Brain with Jim Kwik / a MindValley online course 
* Ultralearning / Scott H. Young
* Deep Work / Cal Newport 
* Indistractable / Nir Eyal

So far I have made some progress in my skills to manage my time, focus and learning process, and to less extent in learning basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Finally, this special personal project of committing 1000-Days-Of-Code borrows from the popular and awesome 100DaysOfCode movement that has inspired and supported a lot of newcomers into coding.

Since late 2015 until today Tuesday April 7th, 2020 (amid the coronavirus Covid-19 Pandemic), almost five years have elapsed, in what has been a meandering, un-finished (barely starting), non-linear career-change journey full of mishaps, mistakes in approach and missed opportunities. Because of this I am taking a long view at this effort of mine to become a professional, proficient and hirable software developer/software engineer, I had added my own twist to the challenge: 

I will play the long game and instead of pledging to commit one hour a day for 100 days straight, I am adding an extra digit and committing to one thousand days of code. 

I want this challenge to become not only a way to create a persistent coding habit, a speedier and steeper learning curve, but also a way of being daily reminded of what I am committed to, a way to come back to something I can visually see the aggregate results of how long I've come out of many chained days, weeks, and months spent on everyday small steps and incremental progress. 

Because "a journey of a thousand miles starts with single step" today I am taking my first chronicled step with the destination away a thousand miles. 

In due time I will be able to look back and say: I was a bookkeeper, now I am a Software Developer. You don't believe me ??? Well, let me show you an account I have at this thing called GitHub ...

As I update my LinkedIn profile and decide to erase my ABOUT text, I thought: It miht be a good idea to paste it inn here, to look back to it as I transition and become a software developer in the ensuing years:

My professional career path has spanned two decades. I started in investment/sales and from there moved on to roles in finance/accounting. I’ve owned a bookkeeping services firm for over seventeen years. A few years forward, while still managing my bookkeeping practice, I was able to insert myself into the challenging real estate industry of Puerto Rico in roles that ranged from asset preservation and field service inspections to full-service real estate brokerage. However, even though finance/accounting can broadly define my professional work career, it has not precluded me from pursuing my many other work/life interests.

Recently, I moved to the great city of Chicago and fully immersed myself in a self-taught learning journey of web and software development. I’m following a path to become a full stack web developer and currently investing my time in learning JavaScript.

Some could wonder how I’ve landed in this technology path. As it went, being a lifelong learner, in early 2016 I decided to learn some skills outside my finance/accounting skill-set and enrolled in a web intro coding boot camp. After graduating from Codetrotters Academy, where I learned the basics of front-end web dev I became passionate about web dev and software development and decided to continue to educate myself to make a career change into this arena in the near future.

Finally, as I change careers, I continue to passionately invest time in my learning journey as I look forward to inserting myself into the local web and software development industry and community, ultimately pursuing an opportunity on a role as a full-stack software developer.
