#### **Insights or thoughts:**
##### My personal state-of-affairs as it relates to my career-change journey into Software Development
I've had a good run of over fifteen years career on finance/accounting roles, but around year 2015 I started toying with the idea of making a career change but had not a clue as to where to pivot. By late 2015 (in San Juan, Puerto Rico) I came across a Codetrotters Academy ad and on early 2016 I invested $1,500.00 to attend a Web Dev Intro Course offered by the former. And I naively thought: I am on my way to soon become a tech/knowledge worker in the new economy; alas, if you continue reading you'll see my current state of affairs. 

Technically speaking, at this coding workshop I did not made a lot of progress nor learned much, but a seed was planted in my mind: the certainty that the tech industry (specifically coders and programmers) was not necessarily a province only reserved for young and genius-minded folks whom spent their early years at their parents' home basements becoming code hackers. Learning to code or for that matter making a career-change into tech was now within my realm of reality. However, for $1,500.00, a rather significant amount of money paid to attend a workshop compared to what an UDEMY course (with twice the amount of skills learning content) costs, I was not able to extract much value in skills from this Codetrotters Web Dev Intro course, but was rather given a more valuable return: I gained the perspective of what at one point I considered an "off limits" option for me, now was an open possibility. Provided that I put in the time and effort, I could, even in the worst case scenario, become an average or mediocre tech worker that could at least scrap an average living income as a software developer. Who cares?; I rather work for an average middle class income and be happy, than for a fortune and be unfulfilled and miserable. So I thought  this is the career-change destination I am looking for. Yet multiple disrupting life events in a tumultous year of 2016 had me wrestling with my circumstances rather than being able to chart a path to a career change.  

By mid-year of 2017, with the worst been over, life had me living in Chicago, and again I started breathing new air for my career change plans. I tried from Amazon & Shopify dropshipping, lost money on online e-commerce courses with huge promises and flat results, and again ended feeling startled and down, but nevertheles kept reading and researching whatever came my way that was tech/coding related. 

Cloud computing, data science, machine learning, AI, IoT, web design, web development, frontend, backend, fullstack, Java, Python, Javascript, sql, mongoDB, frameworks, libraries, UI, UX, devOps, cybersecurity, Kubernetes, Docker, coding bootcamps, and on and on and on ... all these terms I didn't know until recently, but by now I was becoming  more knowledgeable and generally speaking undestood most of them. Still a year had gone by and I was now more confused than before. 

By late 2018 I had researched many boot-camps and was considering the merits of learning in a controlled, guided and structured enviroment. Out of many, Hack Reactor Software Engineer program stood out, and as I started studying their prep materials geared to clear their admissions assesment interview hurdle, I got plunged into an eureka moment: "this feels like something I can do for hours without end. I feel drawn by the abstract intelectual exercise of this type of work, as well as the creative side of it, meaning: the possiblity of creating and building stuff that could be useful not only for me but to others. Who knows, maybe I can create or contribute to build stuff that could indeed make a difference in my community, my country or to the world at large, and at the same time earn a living. This is it, I want to do this".

However, there were still many challenges ahead. This three sum them up: 
1- LACK OF STRUCTURE OR CLEAR PATH 
2- LACK OF SUPPORT 
3- LACK OF MIND CONTROL 

In the beginning, the inmense amount of learning resources available from free to paid, at first seemed like a blessing, but quickly turned into a burden as I wanted to sort the great learning courses from the mediocre ones, from an endless supply of offerings, while mixing in my Hack Reactor learning material. Also, since I am interested in learning x, y, and z, may I go thru many of these multiple resources at the same time ??? Which ones ??? In what sequence ??? A lot of time was wasted in an endless amount of started yet un-finished online courses.

Second, I was for too long shy about going out to find support. This became another source of waste of time, resources and energy, because I kept doing stuff propelled by wrong assumptions of what and how do things. Until recently I did not have a single friend in the tech industry to tend to, to make questions, to have chats regarding this, or to ask for feedback and advice; and worst, I did not reach out to anybody. 
*Ego is the enemy !!!*   

And lastly but of greater impact: LACK OF MIND CONTROL. The lack of discipline to manage distractions, the lost skill of razor focus for long periods of time, the absent ability to quickly switch to think deep and abstractively like in my days as a young book worm, made me realize these were the main reasons why I was spending a great amount of effort and hours going thru my study materials but failing to learn at all, at least at a decent speed. After missed dealines to have learned certain content, after painful failed attempts to pass TI's or other assesments of my skills, I finally came to terms with the fact that learning coding, programming or computer science was not only complex, difficult, and foreign to my lifetime knowledge context, but also that what was hindering my efforts was in my view, a cognitive impairment. My attention was too fragmented, the timespan of my focus was way too short, hence my learning curve was flat. I was taking too long to learn a thing or two, and at this pace it would take an eternity to acquire any value producing skills. In short, I had my first BIG impostor syndrome attack. 
*Stillness and Deep Work are the keys !!!*  

Since then, alongside my coding learning journey I decided to research and read many books on personal improvement topics related to: meta-learning, time management, having focus in spite today's digital distractions, and ultimately managing frustration and anger to impede this normal repetitive human conditions from leading me astray of my long sought personal goal of finding meaning, purpose and a happy life by pursuing work in a career of my liking and choosing. 

For the curious, this is a list of the books and resources that I have read in the last two years, and that I continue to reference and review again and again:

* The Obstacle Is The Way / Ryan Holiday 
* Ego Is The Enemy / Ryan Holiday
* Stillness Is The Key / Ryan Holiday
* The Daily Stoic / Ryan Holiday & Stephen Hanselman
* The Daily Stoic Journal / Ryan Holiday & Stephen Hanselman
* The Organized Mind / Daniel J. Levitin
* Ten Percent Happier / ios app and book by Dan Harris 
* Essentialism / Greg McKeown 
* The First 20 hours / Josh Kaufman  
* The Productivity Project / Chris Bailey 
* Super Brain with Jim Kwik / a MindValley online course 
* Ultralearning / Scott H. Young
* Deep Work / Cal Newport 
* Indistractable / Nir Eyal

So far I have made some progress in my skills to manage my time, focus and learning process, and to less extent in learning basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Finally, this special personal project of committing 1000-Days-Of-Code borrows from the popular and awesome 100DaysOfCode movement that has inspired and supported a lot of newcomers into coding.

Since late 2015 until today Tuesday April 7th, 2020 (amid the coronavirus Covid-19 Pandemic), almost five years have elapsed, in what has been a meandering, un-finished (barely starting), non-linear career-change journey full of mishaps, mistakes in approach and missed opportunities. Because of this I am taking a long view at this effort of mine to become a professional, proficient and hirable software developer/software engineer, I had added my own twist to the challenge: 

I will play the long game and instead of pledging to commit one hour a day for 100 days straight, I am adding an extra digit and committing to one thousand days of code. 

I want this challenge to become not only a way to create a persistent coding habit, a speedier and steeper learning curve, but also a way of being daily reminded of what I am committed to, a way to come back to something I can visually see the aggregate results of how long I've come out of many chained days, weeks, and months spent on everyday small steps and incremental progress. 

Because "a journey of a thousand miles starts with single step" today I am taking my first chronicled step with the destination away a thousand miles. 

In due time I will be able to look back and say: I was a bookkeeper, now I am a Software Developer. You don't believe me ??? Well, let me show you an account I have at this thing called GitHub ...
