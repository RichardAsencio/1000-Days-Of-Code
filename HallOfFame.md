## List 
*this list is not necessarily choronological at this point* 
1. this course really perked up my interest and enthusiasm learning web dev as the FCC course material are very dull [HTML5 & CSS DEvelopment: Learn How To Build a Professional Website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bMdjkfvONE).  


2. This course from Traversy Media [GitHub Pages Deploy & Domain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKXkC4SqtRk) taught me to deploy to GitHub Pages with the gh-pages package. Now I can publish a static webpage to GitHub Pages that can be hosted in another branch than master. This way I can have a branch solely dedicated to host just the files I want to be deployed, and the rest of my fiels and folders can remain on the master branch.
