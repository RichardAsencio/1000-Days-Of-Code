# Ideas for projects

- start drafting a plan to move most of my resources to the cloud, from my adobe docs in CSS to QAS to everyting in between using my Dropb box, icloud and Onedrive - I should have very little stuf locally in my machine / iphone and ios stuff in my icloud, work stuff in my dropbox and personl stuff in my onedrive  and webdesign stuff in my adobde ccreative cloud 

- transfer all my domains to my Blue Host and make sure each one is working fine (all of them)  

- keep going thru all the courses I want to while raking up webpages for my portfolio, form web responsive prokects to bootstrap to framworks, etc etc ... 

- start looking for ideas for a personal portfolio webpage and try to implement it: 
it should have my linkedIn, github link, twitter and facebook and youTube link as well as my personal blog thru the late developer.And then it should showcase a link to each of my projects or apps. And my social media shlud be intertwined between each other

- for the moment use my richardasencio@gmail.com to create a regular plain webpage that will link each one of:
LInks: 
my linked in 
my facebook page, my twitter, youtube, and latedeveolper blog page, plues a page of my portfolio tiems

 - the pages I have made sort of like make different subfolders from my main richardasencio folder (a regular webpage with links to a project portfolio, from the freecode camp projects to the pack projects to the, to rest adares, to bike repair shop, to project 3 and project 4 of Dan, all of them, etc 
look for portfolio webpages ideas to comee up with something very minimalist bit very webreponsive and also complex enough in the front end with probabley some backend stuff 
  
* do a similar portfolio website for me similar to the Jordan Hudgens project 
* do a family or Niletzy personal or family page with the Jordan Hudgens project
* do a La Nena a mockup for her restaurant with the Adare project from Dan Scott 
* do a La Nena mockup for her restaurant that has Dan Scott Adare rest project as 
the home page and Jordan Hudgens porfolio project adapted for the featured menu 
items linked as the menu page (I can post a link to the Adare rest, but wen I use it to another webste lets say for nieltzy i can showcase them one netxt to the other and with explanations of this second one is an adaptation of the first one)
