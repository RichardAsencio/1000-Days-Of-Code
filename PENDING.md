4. I need a project planner software, so why not try to choose a project planner and start using it to have an additional skill before looking for a job? Why not look and research which are the most commonly used in web design and soft dev, like Trello, Asana, Basecamp, or any others ...





/////////////////////////////// All beneath this is: PENDING or afterthoughts STUFF /////////////////////////

My LOG started to get messy and cluttered with all the ideas and things pending to be done if time allows, so I decided to offload all that messiness to another document for the sake of bringing some sanity and cleanliness to my LOG


// 1. what's the file gitignore for? should I have one on each of my repos?
  
// 2. return to [UNIX for Mac OS X Users](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/unix-for-mac-os-x-users/introduction) to Part Three Finder Aliases in UNIX and try to finish this part and leave part four of Sunday, and succesively each part to be done per day (the course has  9 parts) ... once one part is covered move to Typing, Hack Reactor, Git/GiyHub, Web Dev, Web Design, and Python Webscrapers 

// 3. I will continue to include in this log the agenda and all activities actually performed and related to my Software Career journey, even if it is not coding per se, so that as I get started in my day, I start writing my notes here of all I did during the day that is related to this career-change journey; from job search efforts, social media resources I follow, to reading related books, related TV series, people I get to know, course started and finished,  conferences attended, etc

//4. continue reading [Mining Social Media](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mining-social-media/9781098122621/xhtml/cover.xhtml)       

// 5. research and learn about the Terminal and XCode, and Homebrew. Try LinkedIn lEARN, YouTube Corey Schafer and many resources

// 6. complete the Corey Shafer tutorial on [Homebrew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SELYgZvAZbU) 

// 7. check this other video y Corey Schafer on [How I Setup a New Development Machine - using scripts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=kIdiWut8eD8&feature=emb_logo) to automate installs and Save Time 

// 8. learn Homebrew with LinkedIn lEARN platform Corey Schafer You Tube videos / I want to get familiar with HOMEBREW which seems to be a package installer of MAC for the Terminal and see if I have the latest version and if not then see if I can update it. Check first for my LinkedIn LEARN resources as my experience with the Git Essential course was fantastic, and I should leverge my LinkedIn susbcription not only to learn but also if I can hang in my LinkedIn profile any courses finished at the LinkedIn LEARN platform I need to do so ...  

// 9. Once I am familiar with Homebrew I want to research How To Update Git in both my laptops MAC and PC which as of today is 2.23.0 (my MacBook says my curr versions are git version 2.23.0 and 2.26.1.windows.1 respectively)

// 10. Watch any tutorial related to Windows bash terminal 

// 11. continue to sharpen my Git/GitHub skills, this time go back and review Git/GitHub forking, to fork a very nice repo that Robert Groves starred called [Xtremilicious ProjectLearn-Project-Based-Learning](https://github.com/Xtremilicious/ProjectLearn-Project-Based-Learning)

// 12.  watch and do some coding practice with a LikedIn Git Tutorial [Git Essential Training: The Basics](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/git-essential-training-the-basics/use-git-version-control-software-to-manage-project-code) 
// * at the LinkedIn video course I saw that depending on how you installed Git initially you could access it thru the regular Windows Command Line, but since I couldn't access it thru my regular command line but only thru the Bash profile, I went ahead and erased my PC Git Installation, which also erased the Bash software profile, and re-installed again (per the video instructions) and as it turned out, I can't access my git commands thru the regular command line prompt but since I erased my Git, now I have the latest version of it in my Windows machine, which as of today is "git version 2.26.1.windows.1 

// 13. read and follow this [Medium](https://medium.com/@jonathanmines/the-ultimate-github-collaboration-guide-df816e98fb67) article that illustrates on a step by step fashion a certin type of collaboration workflow.

// 14. watch some more video tutorials that I have discovered on Git and choose another one to practice
